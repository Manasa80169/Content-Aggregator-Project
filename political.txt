processing, and automated reasoning tasks. An algorithm is an efficient method that can be
expressed within finite amount of time and space.
An algorithm is the best way to represent the solution of a particular problem in a very simple
and efficient way. If we have an algorithm for a specific problem, then we can implement it
in any programming language, meaning that the algorithm is independent from any
programming languages.
